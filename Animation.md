# [Disney's palace animation]

IU000169 BSc Computer Science Spring '24

# Project Description
This project is based on generating an animation with two user interaction points.

#### Design Ideas and Inspirations

My inspiration originated from a Nintendo DS game I used to play in which Cinderella and other Disney princesses were donned up. I realised how much of our childhood and adulthood is spent loving Disney, so I wanted to recreate that nostalgic experience. As opposed to  the iconic Disney castle appearing at the beginning of every movie, we always see the introduction and wish it lasted a little bit longer so we could enjoy the fireworks. Thus, I came up with the idea to include fireworks as an interactive user point while you can play the intro theme song using special keys on the keyboard.

#### Design Criteria and Outcome
p5.js Functions;
createSlider():Creates a slider element in the HTML document.
createVector():Creates a 2D vector object.
map():Re-maps a number from one range to another.

Custom Functions and Methods;
displayImages():Custom function to display images on the canvas based on Perlin noise for positioning.
mouseReleased():Adds a new SliderFlower object to the sliders_array when the mouse is released.
SliderFlower class: Initializes the SliderFlower object, creates sliders, and positions them in a circular pattern.
update(): Updates the slider values based on a sine wave for dynamic visual effects.

These are an example of the key functions which work together to create an interactive sketch where images are displayed , sliders can be added by mouse clicks, and sound can be controlled via keyboard inputs. The input box allows for user interaction by displaying instructions on how to interact with the sketch.
